# Labs
Labs were a series of smaller programming tasks that were usually tied into the lecture topics of that week. 

A lab folder involves two files:
- one contains my code solutions.
  - This will have the filename `COMP108W0X`, where `X` is the lab number.
- the other can be compiled and run to check whether or not my solutions worked.
  - This file has the same filename but with `...App` appended to it
  - This file was made by my lecturer and not me

Here is a brief summary of what topics each lab covers:
- *week-2* - `COMP108W02.java`
  - Lectures that week were on measuring efficiency and time complexity using big O notation, then looking at some well-known search algorithms 
  - The lab itself is just an easy warm-up introduction with no clear link to the lectures from that week
- *week-3* - `COMP108W03.java`
  - TBC
- *week-4* - `COMP108W04.java`
  - TBC
- *week-6* - `COMP108W06.java`
  - TBC
- *week-7* - `COMP108W07.java`
  - TBC
- *week-8* - `COMP108W08.java`
  - TBC
