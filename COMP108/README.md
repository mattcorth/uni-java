### Lab topic summaries
Labs were programming tasks given to us most weeks. A lab involves two files: one contained my code solutions and the other could be run to test whether or not the code worked. Here is a brief of what topics each lab covers:
- *Lab-2* - See COMP108W02.java for code
  - Lectures that week were on measuring efficiency and time complexity using big O notation, then looking at some well-known search algorithms 
  - The lab itself is just an easy warm-up introduction with no clear link to the lectures from that week
