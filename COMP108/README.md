### Lab topic summaries
- Labs were a series of smaller programming tasks that were usually tied into the lecture topics of that week. 
- A lab folder involves two files:
    - one contains my code solutions. This will have the filename `COMP108W0X`, where `X` is the lab number
    - the other can be compiled and run to check whether or not my solutions worked. This has the same name as the solutions 

Here is a brief of what topics each lab covers:
- *Lab-2* - See COMP108W02.java for code
  - Lectures that week were on measuring efficiency and time complexity using big O notation, then looking at some well-known search algorithms 
  - The lab itself is just an easy warm-up introduction with no clear link to the lectures from that week
