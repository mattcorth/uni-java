# COMP108 - Data structures and algorithms
This is a collection of smaller university projects programmed as part of my 'Data Structures and Algorithms' module, including assignments and weekly labs.

For assignments I will summarise the scenario and what I was tasked to create but I have also included the full brief I was given as a PDF file in case you want more detail.

- Throughout the module, I had six labs.
