### A note on assignment/lab code file structure
An assignment/lab folder involves (at minimum) two files:
1. one contains my code solutions
    - It began as a template containing only function headers
    - It will have the filename:
      - (for assignments) `COMP108AX...`, where `X` is the assignment number.
      - (for labs) `COMP108W0X`, where `X` is the week number.
2. the other can be compiled and run to check whether or not my solutions worked.
    - This file has the same filename but with `...App` appended to it
    - This file was written entirely by my lecturer Dr Prudence Wong

### Labs
- Throughout the module, I had six labs.
- Labs were small programming tasks given to us on some weeks.
- My solutions for these the labs can be found in the [`labs` directory](/COMP108/labs).
