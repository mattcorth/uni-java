// Time Complexity and explanation: You can use the following variables for easier reference.
// n denotes the number of requests, p denotes the size of the cache
// n and p can be different and there is no assumption which one is larger
//
// noEvict(): O(n*p).			This is because the program loops once for each element in rArray -of which there are n- per element in cArray, of which there are p.
//
// evictFIFO(): O(n*p). 		This method is the same as noEvict apart from some extra instructions for evicting pages, which
//								aren't factored into the time complexity because they are relatively insignificant compared to the loops.
//
// evictLFU(): O(n*(p^3)).		This is because it has the same structure where rArray and cArray are looped through						-->   n*p
//								At the start a new array with the same size as cArray is declared and looped through to initialise it to 1	-->  (n*p)*p
//								When working out which page to evict, the program loops through each element of the new array				--> ((n*p)*p)*p
//								Overall, this simplifies to n*(p^3)
//
// evictLFD(): O((n^2)*(p^4))	This is because it has the same structure where rArray and cArray are looped through						-->    n*p
//								When working out which page to evict, new array with the same size as cArray is declared and looped through -->   (n*p)*p
//								When working out the forward distance for each element in the cache, a there is another nested loop
//								However, the inner loop decreases in size each time however, I was unsure about how to represent this		-->  ((n*p)*p)*n*p
//								When working out the largest forward distance there is  another loop of size p								--> (((n*p)*p)*n*p)*p
//								Overall, this simplifies to (n^2)*(p^4)
