// Time Complexity and explanation:
// f denotes initial cabinet size
// n denotes the total number of requests
// d denotes number of distinct requests
// You can use any of the above notations or define additional notation as you wish.
//
// appendIfMiss(): O(d*f)	The method must loop through each request						--> n
//							Each request involves looping through the cabinet				--> n*f
//							If each request was distinct then the program would have to
//							seach the full linked list more often, since there is a greater
//							chance of there being an item that doesn't exist in the list	--> d*f
//
// moveToFront(): O(d*f)	This method has the same problems as the previous method in that distinct requests require	--> d*f
//							a full search of the list although this algorithm is slightly worse off since new nodes are
//							added in the head position but if the requests are distinct, then they won't show up again
//							and might as well be added to the back of the list
//
// freqCount(): O(d*f*f)	The method must loop through each request								--> n
//							Each request involves looping through the cabinet						--> n*f
//							The node re-insertion means that the list must be looped through again	--> n*f*f
//							If each request was distinct then the program would have to
//							seach the full linked list more often, since there is a greater
//							chance of there being an item that doesn't exist in the list			--> d*f*f
