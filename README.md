# Uni-java
Collection of university projects programmed using Java. Several modules used Java as the language of choice, so code has been grouped by module for readability and cohesion. It should be noted that some modules were more coding-heavy than others.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: In most cases, the code files began as a template file written by the lectures that would pre-declare the function identifiers, parameters, and return value types (this was usually done so that lecturers could reduce the likelihood of their checker programs throwing errors.) Thus, some bits of code will be credited to the lecturers but the function bodies and the logic are my work. I did not write any checkers, but they have been included anyway to prove that the code works.
