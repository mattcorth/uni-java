# Uni-Java
Collection of university projects programmed using Java. Several modules used Java as the language of choice, so code has been grouped by module for readability and cohesion. It should be noted that some modules were more coding-heavy than others.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
- In most cases, my code files began as a file written by a lecturer that would pre-declare the function identifiers, parameters, and return value types (this was done to reduce the likelihood of their checker programs throwing errors.)
- Many assignments also include a number of supplementary code files written entirely by the lecturer (e.g. for testing)
- __All code files containing code not written by myself credit the original author in a comment at the top of the file__.
